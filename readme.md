# Python command line game

This game is to practice building a file using OOP. I created a text based simple adventure RPG game with the following features:

1. Multiple starter classes
2. Multiple fights with non combat options
3. In game store

The combat system uses a Dungeons and Dragons roll mechanic based off the random module
